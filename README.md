# EcoSphere 🌱 — ESG Management Platform

**EcoSphere** is a full-stack ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) management platform built for the Odoo Hackathon 2026. It integrates sustainability tracking directly into everyday operations — turning ERP-style transactional data into automated carbon accounting, employee CSR participation, governance compliance, and gamified engagement, all rolled up into live ESG scores.

Most ERP systems collect operational data but leave ESG reporting manual and disconnected. EcoSphere closes that gap: emissions are calculated automatically from operational records, employees earn XP and badges for sustainability actions, compliance issues are tracked to resolution, and management gets a real-time weighted ESG score across every department.

## Core Modules

- 🌍 **Environmental** — Emission factor configuration, automated carbon accounting from operational data, sustainability goals, and department-level carbon tracking
- 🤝 **Social** — CSR activity management, employee participation tracking with proof-of-completion, and engagement scoring
- ⚖️ **Governance** — Policy management, employee acknowledgements, audits, and compliance issue tracking with ownership and due dates
- 🏆 **Gamification** — Challenges with a full lifecycle (Draft → Active → Under Review → Completed), auto-awarded badges, redeemable rewards, and leaderboards
- 📊 **Reports & Analytics** — Environmental, Social, Governance, and ESG Summary reports with CSV export

## ESG Score Formula

```
Department Score = (Environmental × 0.40) + (Social × 0.30) + (Governance × 0.30)
Organization Score = Average of all Department Scores
```

> Weights are configurable via Settings.

---

## Gamification Rules

| Action | Reward |
|---|---|
| Complete a Challenge | XP defined per challenge |
| Participate in CSR Activity | Fixed XP on approval |
| Acknowledge ESG Policy | Compliance XP |
| Submit proof for sustainability activity | Bonus XP |

XP thresholds auto-unlock **Badges**. Accumulated XP can be redeemed for **Rewards** (stock-limited). Redemption deducts XP automatically.

| **System Admin** | Full access — configure everything |
| **ESG Manager** | Manage all ESG modules and reports |
| **Department Manager** | Manage department activities and view scores |
